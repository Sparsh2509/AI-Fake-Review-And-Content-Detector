"This ball and squeeker has outlasted all the other squeaky dog toys, including the hippo kong, kyjen Platypus plush squeaky eggs.  The Kyjen Invicibles Plush Snake Stuffingless dog toy is still squeaking and in pretty good shape, the pup detached some trim but couldn't figure out how to tear it up.  She shreaded her Kong Ballistic Ring dog toy in nothing flat, sadly.",0
"I really enjoyed this mystery as everything just fell in place from the start to finish. Of course there was a death to figure out the who dunnit part and then finish with a wedding. It was not a traditional wedding, but a wedding right along. A good read.",0
Puppy loves this donkey. She's a bit aggressive with it. I've had to stitch part of the neck back up. The sound box works great. No sign of her being able to remove it. I would buy this again if he meets his demise since he's her favorite.,0
Mine came brand new practically. It's so warm with all them put together perfect sleeping bag should last a life time if stored well.,0
"Cuts perfect and last for an extremely long time. We use Freud exclusively in our shop. Best blades on the market. Only thing I would change would be to make them without the red paint. It sometimes transfers to the material that is being cut and has to be sanded off. On the other hand, the red blades look cool. This 40 tooth cuts better than other brands with 90+ tooth blades.",0
I love this watch!  It's smaller than expected but very well made and I love the colors as well.  I think I may have found a new favorite watch designer.,0
"Used this for a ""broadcast ON-THE-AIR"" sign illluminator and it is very bright, very red(!), the light is evenly dispersed, and uses less than 2 watts!  Love it!",0
I never saw the original so I guess I don't have that to compare it to like most of the reviews on here. I thought it was a good movie for the most part. A little cliche and predictable at points but there are a million movies out there. It's kind of hard to be completely original. I'm not a crazy movie critic though. I enjoyed sitting down and watching this. My life isn't ruined. It's a movie.,0
"I've had this Lunchbots for over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful for dry goods.  My original intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice for that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way for me to know for certain whether there's lead, cadmium, or other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping for a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for)

So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 for a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

Best & Respectfully--",0
"I have three of these now, switched out all my AR Platform scopes with these.  They are light but excitedly rugged, and with 1"" inch inserts handle 1"" scope beautifully as well.  The  MOA return to zero isn't bunk, I've generally seen either spot on or at most a  MOA difference after dismounting for cleaning.  I originally decided to try one for just that reason, the ability to clean, but when I look at the precision rings, 20 MOA rails etc. these are very hard too beat and real value for their cost.  When you regularly shoot 300-600 yards with an AR this is the mount to have.",0
"Great read!  I couldn't put this down, and I can't to read the next one.  The author knows what he's doing and his writing shows that he has a mastery of the language.",0
"I have friends who are SCCA corner workers and others who are EMTs and Firefighters. Both are jobs that can involve cutting, prying open, grabbing hot or sharp things, etc.  I saw this as a good tool to keep in my car to use ""just in case"" I had a chance to be a hero, like my friends. But first, I brought it to church to show my firefighter friend and get his thoughts. Here's what he said:

He thought it was a little heavy to carry but he thought he would be able to substitute it for a couple of other tools he carries. He liked the combo pliers/wire cutters and saw how they could be used to turn, bend or cut through wires or grills. He immediately recognized the key slot that could close gas valves. The pry bar end too could be useful to open stuck doors or smash windows. Finally, and the reason for only 4 stars, the fire hose tightened isn't very useful since he say that you really need two to snug up the joint.

Quality build, several useful tools, a little heavy, worth a try for the heros in your life!",0
"Here's a wonderful book for any fan of Ursula Le Guin. It begins with a foreword by the author in which she outlines each of the stories, most of which take place on worlds of her well-known Ekumen, her &#147;Hainish Universe.&#148;. However alien the cultures may be, however strange their societal structures and customs, Ms. Le Guin uses each tale to underscore what truly unites us and makes us human. These stories comprise the first two-thirds of the book.
As much as I relish Le Guin&#146;s Hainish stories, it is the novelette &#147;Paradises Lost,&#148; comprising the final third of the book, that is most rewarding. It&#146;s a change of pace for the author, involving not the worlds of the Ekumen, but rather a generation spacecraft on a 201-year voyage from Earth to a &#147;New Earth&#148; orbiting some unnamed neighboring star. Most of the narrative involves characters who have lived their entire lives in this self-contained bubble of metal and air. They know nothing of Earth save what they have experienced via films and &#147;virtual reality&#148; programs. The simple concept of &#147;sky&#148; is completely unfathomable to them. They have their own rituals and customs with which they structure their lives until it becomes necessary to debark on the surface of a new world. Ultimately, for some hese colonists who have become comfortable in their self-contained universe, the notions of OUTSIDE and NEW WORLD begin to seem rather intimidating and even evil. How will they cope when the spacecraft arrives at its destination? Ms. Le Guin deftly explores this culture and its destiny, and the ending quite literally brought tears to my eyes. Throughout &#147;The Birthday of the World,&#148; we realize how much we have in common as human beings, no matter whether we are on Gethen, in a spaceship, on Earth, or anywhere in the universe, that we have our loves, our hopes, and our fears, and that EVERY DAY is the birthday of the world.",0
The ramp is too skinny and steep. The dogs won't use it.  Was a waste of money.,0
This book answered a lot of questions that the previous books in this series had raised. It was a good stand- alone but also it fit well into the previous set of stories.,0
My 7 month old loves his Caterpillar! He enjoys shaking it up and down so he can hear the rattlers. He also loves the different textures and gnawing on the antennas (they are barley over an inch so I don't worry about him gagging on them. It is one of his favorite toys!,0
"Button placement not consistent with how I use it for coping molding.

I use a coping saw to rough cut my molding, and use this to get shave things down to a 1/32 of a inch.  It's too thick to hold like a pen, so I hold it like a paring knife.  The LEDs shine in my eyes so I had to block them with masking tape (there's no on/off).  The locking button (for changing bits) sometimes gets pushed when I'm holding it, and it's inconvenient to increase the speed while I'm using it since the speed buttons are on the other end.

Otherwise it's very useful...",0
"Good collar, wide enough to prevent discomfort. Fit my heeler perfectly.",0
"Construction is ok.  Another chinazon company with a half dozen brands of the identical helmet to spread bad rating around.  I rate it 3 stars because all the Velcro pieces that hold the liner in, needed to be glued properly as they came unstuck on the first removal for washing.  The only way to know if it actually meets any impact standards is to destroy it and I'm not made of money.  I just now knocked a star off because I just realize they don't even claim to meet any impact standards whatsoever.",0
"Terrible product.

Does not support ""Wireless AP"" mode. Even if you manually disable DHCP, turn off SPI firewall, plugin  using LAN ports, it still restricts access to lan devices.

Also, it has LOTs of bugs including:
-Cannot allow WAN administration  from any BOGON networks. It looks like you can, but then errors out. Before applying settings
-By default it has vLAN tagging on port 3 and 4. but documentation does not tell you.
-Web admin interface is NOT httpS, and has no option to enable https.
-DNS is forcefully bound to the WAN port, thus to use it as a Wireless AP you must have a LAN cable attached... AND a LAN cable.
-Wireless defaults to use captive portal, even with guest Network turned off. So you have to enable guest Network, disable captive portal, click save, then disable guest Network again and NOW the non-guest network will work like it should. GAH! No way should anyone have to deal with this junk...

I have been trying to tell myself to just accept this devices issues, but even after hours of changing settings, it is impossible to make it work like it is supposed to. It is not even consistent, sometimes it will not let you connect, or will start dropping packets, so I have to use my old wireless as it, while older technogy, is reliable.

ONLY good thing about this device... the wireless range is very good. Unfortunately because some days it decides to just drop packets randomly, the range benefit is useless :(

*Note: TP-Link devices are ONLY good if you wipe original firmware and use OpenWRT. I have an older WDR4300 and a WDR810, with OpenWRT they work well... just old technology, unfortunately because Archer C9 uses Broadcom chip you cannot use OpenWRT.",0
"Bought this set for my wife to snorkeling in the Bahamas. She did and the guide/ lead snorkeler told here this set was a top line one. Not the very best, but really good. So get yours today!",0
Great story!! I enjoyed the development of the characters and can't wait to see how Sophia and Marc handle taking their relationship to the next level.  Thanks for a great read!!,0

My two cats love these fur teasers. I put one on a long pole  ( made by the same company with feathers ) and my cats were jumping and stalking this fur teaser to the point that I could hardly put it away without them trying to grab it and take it to hide. You will have a lot of fun and bonding time with your cat(s) with this toy !,0
"I really enjoyed this book. It is a cliff hanger, so be warned of you really don't like that. I usually don't mind, but I kind of did with this one. Shortly after beginning the book, I knew she wasn't going to may the guy she was dating, but I thought she would marry another character in the book. That didn't happen, although I suspect she will in another book. One thing I really didn't like was at the end it announced that the guy she dated for most of the book was engaged, but it didn't day to whom (although I'm pretty sure whom). Still, it was a very enjoyable read. The characters were very likeable & the book was very clean.",0
"As I've gotten older, my foot has changed, and I can now only wear sandals like these that have support.  I can wear them all day walking everywhere, and my feet don't hurt!

"Bought the multi-level climbing block assuming one of them woyld be level.  Never could get bike level using it, may be why they call it a climbing block...hmmmmm.  Anyhow, this one is perfect, and keeps teh front level with teh rear when mounted to my powerbeam pro.",0
The story continued well written and had me enthralled from the get go.,0
"Enthralling doesn't even begin to cover this book. Ms. Kelly's story-telling and writing style in this book was more than I could have hoped for. The story was exciting, hot, and hilarious. The plot had me staying up into the night to read longer than I should have. The female characters are strong and take no-nonsense from the alpha males in their lives. The snarky, sassy personalities had me laughing and at times cringing at their crazy, yet courageous acts. Willow is incredibly strong and doesn't hold back. This makes for, at times, a hilariously volatile interaction with Mal. Mal is your alpha male with an overprotective personality. Oh yeah they are complete opposites! I'm not sure which characters I loved more though. The secondary characters were almost as involved as the main characters and had me falling in love with them and solidifying my new addiction to this series. I'm now impatiently waiting for Book 2 and my next love match. Nothing better than a promise of more of my new loves being the center of their own books. If you haven't read this book you need to! This author has yet to disappoint me but this is some of her best!",0
"I'm new to sourdough bread baking and new to the world of bread knives. My bread is super crusty on the bottom. Yes the knife is sharp. Yes it cuts very thin slices super straight and easily. However, when I get to the bottom of the slice I do have to saw a bit to get through it. The knife is flexible, and I'm not used to the feel of that, but it does a good job. It arrived quickly.",0
Love it. Got it for the Note 10.1 2014. Love the many angles to adjust the screen. All ports and buttons are available while in the case. High quality and secure.,0
This book is great. A guy turns his life around and becomes so much more. I can't wait to read more.,0
"I purchased the Capstar as a extra layer of security for my dog , it's probably one of the best medication to use for dogs  and cats it's non toxic for our animals and knock out fleas in 30 minutes . I also use the Seresto Fkea Collar on my Dal but in case it stops working before I can get another one on her I can give her a Capstar and know I've still got her protected from Fleas thanks to Capstar . According to my vet any flea medication is only 99% effective and knowing how well Capstar works for both cats and dogs I keep both of my animals protected ,I use Capstar for cats and small dogs as well for a backup . Thank you for the prompt shipping .",0
First I want to say thanks for gifting me this book. I really loved it. Ready for part two already,0
"This is a great bathroom radio.  It's moisture resistant, compact, and fairly attractive.  More importantly, the controls are very easy to operate, even with wet hands, and it sounds very good.  It has a weather band that is very useful.

I think it would be hard to do much better than this for a bathroom radio, and I recommend it most highly.",0
"Seemed to be a tad under 1-1/4"" - I wound up sending it back right away because the fit was a little sloppy on my buckle.",0
"The book was so, so good. I couldn't put it down because I definitely wanted to find out how this story was going to play out.  Talk about the sexy banter between Amber and Lance...so, good!  Lance mouth was just so deliciously sexy, off the chain.  Amber says ""You're not coming over"" Lance says ""I will be there and we both will be coming later""......Daym that was Hot!!  He can sneak in my bedroom at my parents house anytime!  The character development was really good, nice little twist in there.....I TOTALLY LOVED IT!  Lance became my favorite when I read ""Mate for Gideon""...He called Sarah, Prim (Ms. Prim & Proper), next to my boy Zane..I mean vamp..Love Zane!  Talk about eating humble pie...I  don't want to give anything away but when I read about the door slamming in the face, I thought that was the ultimate.  Ah mannnn, I died laughing, it was GREAT!  KARMA is something!  I loved the fact that Charlene brought back previous mates, I wish there was a bit more conversation, but it was cool.  Brant, Zane, lil Sam and Tanya...Tanya still holding off on sex to get her way??  She's something.  I totally hope Charlene give us story on the Elf Prince..who was the vamp he fell in love with, Brant's secretary?? I'm dying to find out!  Can't wait for Titan to get a mate. He's all messed up, want to read more about that species relations thing, hope there's a shifter females and vamp hook-up, witches were mentioned and did they say dragon shifters....Whoaaaa!  Looking forward to reading that....Keep these fun stories coming Charlene, they're great!",0
"Horrid! She's childish, hypocritical , repetitive, & completely dislikable. He's supposed to be alpha male billionaire , but begs, grovels, pleads, & bends over backward to become some Styrofoam vanilla ice cream cone for this chickNOTHING alpha about tgis dude! Boring! Repetitive ! Mundane! Longest an most boring sex scenes ive ever readim talking 20 plus pages of undressing, inner monologues, & grinding before another 10 pages of actual getting down to some boring intercourse.",0
"This is a fantastic book!  I enjoyed every page -- through humor, poignancy, insights.
I'd highly recommend this book to just about everybody.",0
My son likes this but because it folds in half the tent style doesn't stay upright for long. Keeps collapsing.,0
"It seems that getting older hasn't been a good thing for Mr. Higgins. His writing has become predictable and mundane. In this book Mr. Higgins often repeats character descriptions. It also always seems to rain in ""torrents"" . So much so that London would surely be suffering serious flooding. Also there is less differentiation among characters then there has been in Mr. Higgin's earlier works. I don't believe I will purchase another of his Sean Dillian books. They seem to be all the same story with less and less differentiation among plot lines.",0
"It is way to small, possibly perfect for maybe a small person? I am confused because an XL is suppose to mean Extra Large not Small...
One star for soft material and because zero wasn't optional.",0
"My daughter likes it, but it is literally the same story with a few embellishments as all the other Diana Prince/Princess Diana becomes Wonder Woman. Her mom doesn't want her to compete, she competes, she wins, she disguises herself, she saves mankind on the daily.

Sigh, good think 5 year-olds are fans of the familiar.",0
Spiritual. I would recommend this book for the spiritual journey it takes you through out the story. It is a feel good book.,0
I loved this book it made me smile and cry one of his best! Can't wait to read the next book.,0
For a cheap little car it was a lot of fun playing with it,0
"we like this little opener, real easy on my hands.",0
Well I agree with many reviews that the publisher often repackages previously published books into a new title to trick us but I don't remember having read any of these.  I have read all of ine In Death series orhottesthot I had.  Anyway I enjoyed these and have pre-ordered the next book.  Love having them all on my Kindle.,0
"What a ridiculous product.

I wanted to be able to download large numbers of photographs directly to this WD drive, but that is not possible. You must first download to your main drive, THEN TRANSFER ALL YOUR FILES MANUALLY to the WD drive for mirroring and cloud access. Needless to say, no one has time for that.

And the worst thing is, I didn't connect this device within the 30-day window for returns. So it's useless, and cannot be returned.

Ugh and fail all around.",0

"This case has held up for about 8 months with two little male monsters. It has been dropped, thrown, drug, bounced, tossed, tickled, abused, hit, kicked, stood on, and fought over on a daily basis. Now that I write this review I'm starting to think that two-year-olds should not have an iPad. However, if you are nuts like me you can rest assured knowing that your iPad will survive anything your kids can throw at it.",0
The story was well written and I enjoyed reading about this time frame in Canada. Interesting to read about women's suffrage in Boston and Canada.,0
"It has hooks on one surface like in Velcro, that was a surprise. Pretty sure it performed better than the other brand that has green & yellow sponge on magnets.",0
"Mounted this on the stem of a Schwinn Excursion bike.  Easy to install with the provided O-Rings.  Wireless sensor mounted easily as well with its own O ring.  The spoke magnet was a little tricky to install but once I had it oriented the right way (directions are not crystal clear) it went off without a hitch.  The wheel sensor has a little green led that flashes when it detects the magnet so you can test the distance between magnet and sensor to make sure its correct and working.

The display comes setup for handle bar mounting but instructions are clear and simple if you need to change its orientation on the base plate for stem mounting.  The computer twists off the base plate so you can pocket it and walk away when leaving the bike locked up in a  dicey area.  The instruction book comes with a tire chart so you can set tire size without having to measure anything.

Keep in mind that the display never actually turns off; when it detects no activity for a while (15? minutes) it switches to standby mode and just shows computer model number.  Even with that the battery (CR2032) is said to last a year in both the computer and speed sensor so we will see.

The instruction booklet is a little dense as every page repeats the instruction in 5 or 6 languages but fairly simple to follow.",0
"What a great little movie.  I had never heard of this, but it popped up on my recommendations and got good reviews, so I gave it a try.  This so much reminded me of Donald Westlake's comic crime caper novels.  A great little story with plenty of laughs.  The plot involves a group of low rent, misfit criminals trying to pull of a heist of a lifetime, or as the call it, their 'Bellini'.  Well, complications occur, problems arise, and the whole thing gets rather messy.  William H. Macy is great along with Isaiah Washington, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, and Luis Guzman.  A great ensemble cast in a highly enjoyable, funny movie.  A sad note, I had heard Michael Jeter died recently, which is quite sad.  I thought he was great in the Green Mile.",0
"I don't watch much TV, but my husband was watching it one night and I sat down to be with him.  Well, I am HOOKED on this series.  I now own season 1, season 2 and have pre-ordered season 3.  The action is taut and thrilling and the interactions of the characters just grows on you, the acting is so real you almost think it's really happening.  I would recommend this to any ""horror"" story lover.",0
Works well definetly better than using vice clamps to remove hose clamps,0
"The light was brighter than others I have tried and I thought I would love it. I did love it for about a week and then it started to flash on and off very quickly.  Like there was a dance party going on in my yard:) it was not worth the Money to pay to send it back.  Very sad because, like I said it does throw a fair amount of light and even has choice of high or low mode.",0
"Excellent, you retain your mobility while carrying essential gear

It was a good book if you like that era. Some parts of it were a little far fetched but still a good read.,0
Story is pretty good so far will have to read the rest to see if it continues.  Not my favorite line of story but all in all grabs at you so that you want to see what Charlie will do.,0
This was a Christmas gift to my 8 year old and he loves it.  We set it up Christmas day and then left for a few days.  When we came back one of the cars wouldn't operate as it did before we left.  We did some switched batteries and tried some minor problem solving but the car just wouldn't work correctly.  Contacted the company and received a prompt response back.  Did the steps as was recommended to us from Tech Support and then gave them the results.  They again responded promptly and advised that they would need to send out a calibration tool but with the holidays and such we wouldn't have it until after the 1st of the year.  No problems here.  Rec'd the calibration tool earlier than I expected and performed the steps that were supplied and everything works great!  Couldn't be happier with the support we rec'd.  ...and love this racetrack.  Would definitely recommend.,0
I can't say enough good things about this ROku.  My wife loves it and the headset on the remote.,0
"I like this item a lot.  Packs up small, nice little case.  I would like to have seen some reinforced grommets but that is a nitpick.  The fact I could fold it back up and get it back in its pouch is enough of a selling point for me.  Good bit of emergency kit.",0
"I thoroughly enjoyed these stories of childhood friends/lovers who were separated for reasons beyond their control and moved on with their lives. When they are reunited some 10 years or so later, sparks fly again and the chemistry between them is as strong as ever, but they must learn to let go of past hurts and rediscover each other again. The last story was a pleasant surprise because it was a contemporary romance instead of a regency romance like the first two, which was a nice change of pace.",0
"I love the Chuckit brand and the orange rubber balls are my dog's favorite so I thought for sure he'd love this one too. I'm not positive but I think it might be a tiny bit harder than the orange ones? Why am I rating a 4 when my dog doesn't like it? It's still a good, durable toy and I'm sure lots of other dogs would love it. My dog is obviously just a spoiled brat lol :)",0
The light shines bright and works like a charm to brighten up a dark room.,0
"This was on my hubby's xmas gift list.  He just loves it and uses it every day.  It is sturdy, attractive and easy to use.  My only problem with it is that we got the peppercorns long before the pepper mill arrived.",0
"They fit as expected, well ventilated for summer walks/runs, and I don't get blisters while wearing them. I have a hard step and I'm very active...have tried several different ""top-of-the-line"" well known brands, and have now settled on these as my go-to.",0

"I used to use a $1000 Lamello biscuit joiner when I worked in a cabinet shop. The dealt works amazingly well for how much it costs. I'm not saying it's as good as the Lamello, but its hard to tell the difference. This thing is accurate, easy to use, and I love the rack and pinion adjustment.",0
"The immersion blender itself is quite nice.  I like the adjustable speed - you can use a lower speed when blending in a smaller vessel.  But the accessories are terrible.  My plastic beaker leaks.  I know - hard to imagine a plastic beaker leaking, but sure enough this one drips out the bottom.  And the chopper attachment has no bearings there so it makes a shrieking sound when it runs.  I suppose it'll probably be quieter if you chop oily foods, but i was mixing dry ingredients.  I was actually trying to grind spices and found the blade too dull for that.  Probably not what it's meant for, so i can't blame the tool for that one.",0
You did it again Rhonda. I loved Chris and Kate in this sequel. And those Garrison females are something else. I hope we get to see if Chris wins an Oscar and if they ever get a chance to start that family they want. Keep them coming.,0
"I'm 5'9"" and 145lbs. The small fit me around the waist but they were too short. I wish these came in a longer pant size. The waist on the top was slightly boxy, and the fabric was slightly stiff - these issues would probably get better with washing. I like how there are so many pockets and the gathered waist in the back seems nice and secure so your pants won't fall down when you bend over.",0

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands.",0

"Ms. Hamilton continues to raise the bar in her latest, book 2 of the Highland Gardens time travel highland romance series, that is believable and history rich. It is filled with intrigue, finding love, and commitment to family. Finn is a high-powered modern rich man who longs for true love and a family like his cousin Laurie. He character is developed in such a matter that one has empathy and understanding that money and hotness doesnt always bring you happiness but more often loneliness and uncertainty as to who are your true friends and what true love is. Wow I love Elspeth, she is a strong woman but due to the era she was born and family duty puts love before family. Her character is truly thought provoking and though you want to scream don't take that from your fianc&eacute; we truly understand what the mens beliefs about women were back then compared to today. From my viewpoint there weren't any strong secondary characters but Caitrina and Douglas seemed to deserve a story. So for now I am waiting impatiently for book 3 of this series Just Wait For Me, A Highland Gardens Novel. To see the full review visit my blog: sportochicksmusings. blogspot.",0
"loved the scissors style tool, the tweezers and the bulb syringe.  The yellow tool (pictured on the left hand side) was pretty cool, BUT it broke the first day of use.  The quality of that tool was not as good as the other three.",0
"This was an excellent book. It introduces new and useful information (& conceptualizes older information) about a topic that is increasingly influencing human beings, and other animals. A bit scary, but inevitable.",0

"This really isn't even the same tool as the 2-ton cable puller.  I mean it is, but this thing is MASSIVE.  It weighs about 35 pounds and looks able to pull a house over.  The thing is so big it's almost difficult to work with.  You need to be rather strong to get it moved around set up even before you begin cranking.

This is very well made, of exceptional quality, and amazingly strong.  Made right here in the good old USA.  You can buy this thing, use the tar out of it, and give it to your grown child someday and he can then give it to his kid some day.  Really, it's that well made.  I just wish the manual did a little better job of indicating lubrication points.  Perhaps if it had a picture with arrows indicating spots to lubricate.",0

"Used the dress to do a 1920s inspired photoshoot. Dress fit the model as expected and seemed very durable for a 'costume' dress. The fringe and sequins held up well during the photoshoot. The fringe flowed really well while the model was dancing and moving making for some really great action shots. This would be an acceptable dress to wear out to any masquerade or 1920s themed event or as a halloween costume. The sequin trim in the neckline felt a little cheap, but from a distance or in photos it looks great!",0

"This bacon cooking product is much more efficient than a previous, different style of bacon/microwave cooker. It is less messy with only one paper towel draped across the top. You can see how the bacon is cooking and either shorten the cooking time or lengthen it to have bacon just the way you like it or need it. Sometimes we need partially cooked bacon to use in recipes where it needs to be flexible for incorporation with other food, and then cooked to completion. This product perfectly satisfies that need. I highly recommend this product for anyone who uses/enjoys perfect bacon.",0

"My Boston Terrier has MegaEsophogus which causes regurgitation of food eaten hours earlier.  It's a must that I have a harness that falls below the throat while walking him as this exacerbates his condition.  With this ""Step-in"" harness, it sits low on his chest yet does a good job of holding him back.  Putting the harness on can be a bit of a challenge but I've figured that out rather quickly.  There is a bit of stretch after a month or 2 of use but not enough to make the harness useless.  And you can tighten it if you need to. All in all I am very pleased.",0

"This was an illuminating biography of a real boundary breaker.  Francis Perkins, whose politics leaned a bit further left than I personally stand, was nevertheless a thoroughly impressive female leader in a setting where outright hostility and malevolence based on gender alone was not only accepted but seemingly encouraged.  Ms. Perkins' sublime way of sidestepping blustering male counterparts and outwitting (and outworking) male adversaries whilst earning stolid loyalty and respect from open-minded men of the day remain admirable and shocking to a woman born in the late 20th century.  This is a great read!",0

60kg for medium sized dogs
retractable dog leash. Made of environmentally protection material TPE. ABS has a nice rubber grasp that is easy to hold and your hand does not slip off.
you press down on the black button to lock  and release to let it go. 4 meter cord.
the light takes three triple a batteries ( you have to provide those)
the light is very bright which I love. I live in the country so it is dark at night to take out the dog it is nice to have a built in light I do not have to search for. you can also take the light off if you want and hold it in your hand. I like to leave it as one piece so I don't lose it.
really well made hard durable plastic and the end of the leash has light reflector so you can be seen in the dark by cars.
I like this one very much and my pomerian who is three pounds can use it just fine.",0
"If they are shipped right they are supposed to be firm blocks that's easily crumbled into powdery flaky smell so good goodness for the cats (it appeals to my sense of smell and I HATE the smell of any wet can food)

I have no idea why people don't bother to just crumble it the way I do is just squeeze it firmly and add water and nutritional yeast (for the one cat with on/off diarrhea) and just give it a good stir. It takes less than a minute tops to be throughly mixed and water is absorbed. The cats do like it dry too but I rather have water in it to give them more moisture in their diet as they eat Orijen dry cat food. I also give them Stella and Chewys freeze dried food added into the mix some days as they eat that for treats.

My bengal is the picky eater the American Bobtail is the one with sensitive tummy and the sole reason why I brought a trail sized bag to test run it to give her supplements and she likes it as well as the Bengal so cant go wrong with this product but I strongly suggest you to purchase the trail size to test run it. Just crumble it its so easy to squeeze it and seeing it just flake away. I like the ease of grabbing a firm block instead of a messy thing.",0
"To date, I have read Nikki's Secret, Text Message and Scrapping the Bone and I have to tell you, William Malmborg delivers. His stories are not for meek, but they are not so far out there that people will be offended or put off by reading them. What I love about Malmborg's work is that it is a little racey, a little raunchy and a whole lot of fun. The story lines flow. Once you start reading, you cannot stop. It's like opening up a huge bag of Dorito's and saying ""I'll just have a few"". Can't do it. You dive into one of his books and you will be reading until 4 am just to see what the heck Nikki's Secret is, or how is Mallory going to walk into that men's bathroom and do that thing? You just have to find out. Each book is a decadent pleasure, a pure delight that you can sink your teeth into and get lost in the process.

"This particular canine amusement apparatus, comprising a spherical component and an integrated sound-generating element, has demonstrated exceptional durability when contrasted with a variety of other comparable playthings. Notably, its longevity surpasses that of the Kong Hippo model, as well as the Kyjen Platypus Plush Squeaky Eggs.

The Kyjen Invincibles Plush Snake Stuffingless dog toy, specifically, remains fully functional in terms of its acoustic output and is in a condition of considerable integrity. While the juvenile canine has managed to dislodge some decorative trim, it has been unable to achieve structural compromise. Regrettably, the Kong Ballistic Ring dog toy succumbed to rapid disassembly by the same animal.",1
"This mystery novel proved to be a highly engaging experience, characterized by a seamless narrative flow from its inception to its resolution. The central plot ingeniously incorporated a well-defined homicide, serving as the catalyst for the investigation into the perpetrator's identity. The narrative arc culminated in a wedding celebration, which, while perhaps unconventional in its specifics, nonetheless provided a fitting conclusion. Overall, this work is recommended as a worthwhile and satisfying read.",1
"Here is a rewritten version of the product review, adhering to your specifications:

This particular canine companion exhibits a strong affinity for the donkey toy. While the puppy demonstrates a rather vigorous engagement with the product, necessitating minor repairs to the neck area, the integrated sound mechanism remains fully operational and secure. There is no indication of the sound box being dislodged. Given its status as the pet's preferred item, a repurchase would be considered should the toy sustain irreparable damage.",1

"This product demonstrates exceptional cutting performance, delivering precise results and exhibiting remarkable longevity in its operational lifespan. Our professional facility has standardized on Freud brand blades due to their consistently superior quality and performance, positioning them as the premier option currently available.

A singular area for potential enhancement would be the elimination of the red paint application. While aesthetically pleasing, instances have been observed where this coloration transfers to the workpiece, necessitating a subsequent sanding procedure to rectify. Conversely, the visual appeal of the red-hued blades is acknowledged and appreciated by some users.

It is noteworthy that this 40-tooth configuration achieves a superior cutting efficiency compared to competing blades featuring significantly higher tooth counts, often exceeding 90 teeth.",1

A significant operational advantage is its remarkably low power consumption, registering at less than 2 watts. This combination of factors has resulted in a highly satisfactory user experience.",1
"Here are a few options for the rewritten review, maintaining the original meaning with a polished, balanced, and slightly formal AI-style tone:

**Option 1 (Concise and Direct):**

> Lacking prior exposure to the original work, a direct comparative analysis is not feasible. Nevertheless, the film is assessed as largely successful. While certain narrative elements exhibited predictability and a degree of cliché, it is acknowledged that achieving complete originality in cinematic productions presents a considerable challenge. This reviewer does not possess a specialized critical background, but found the viewing experience to be enjoyable and a satisfactory expenditure of time.

**Option 2 (Slightly More Elaborate):**

> As this is my initial engagement with the material, I am unable to offer a comparative perspective against the original iteration, unlike some prior assessments. Overall, the motion picture is deemed to be of good quality. It is recognized that some junctures contained predictable plot devices and conventional thematic elements, however, the pursuit of absolute originality in filmmaking is inherently complex. While not a professional film critic, the experience of viewing this film was found to be pleasurable and did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the cinematic medium.

**Option 3 (Emphasizing Enjoyment):**

> Without the benefit of having viewed the original production, a comparative review is beyond my current capacity. My general impression of this film is predominantly positive. While it is acknowledged that some sequences adhered to established conventions and offered predictable resolutions, it is understood that absolute originality in narrative cinema is an infrequent achievement. My engagement with this film was that of a casual viewer, and I found the experience to be an enjoyable one, fulfilling its purpose as a form of entertainment.

"This review evaluates the performance of the Lunchbots container after an extended period of use, approximately one year. The product has demonstrated utility primarily for the storage of dry goods. The initial purchase motivation was to acquire an ""heirloom"" quality lunchbox, with stainless steel being selected for its perceived food-safe properties.

However, sustained use has revealed a notable issue with the exterior coating. The paint has consistently chipped away, resulting in its presence within the carrying tote, on the container's rim, and, under certain circumstances, within the food itself.

In consideration of contemporary consumer awareness regarding material safety, and the inability to definitively ascertain the absence of potentially toxic elements such as lead or cadmium in the paint, the container is slated for disposal. This determination directly informs the current search for a replacement item that is constructed entirely of stainless steel. The purpose of this review is to disseminate this experience to assist other prospective purchasers.

A prior suggestion indicated a highly responsive customer service department at Lunchbots, capable of replacing lids without reservation. This has not been the reviewer's experience. Contact with customer service yielded a standardized response indicating that the product was beyond its warranty period and that the observed paint degradation was classified as normal wear and tear. The option to purchase replacement lids, which are also painted, was offered at the consumer's expense. It is understood that the product is subject to a one-year warranty.

This experience suggests a disparity between perceived product quality and manufacturer support relative to the investment of approximately $20 for a stainless steel item intended for longevity beyond a single year.",1
"This product has demonstrably replaced all previously utilized AR platform scopes. Its lightweight construction belies an impressive ruggedness, and the inclusion of 1-inch inserts facilitates seamless integration with 1-inch scopes. The advertised MOA return to zero capability has been consistently validated in practical application, with observed deviations rarely exceeding 1 MOA post-disassembly for maintenance. Initial selection was motivated by the desire for convenient cleaning access. However, upon comparative evaluation with more complex mounting solutions featuring 20 MOA rails and precision rings, the exceptional value proposition of this product becomes evident. For individuals engaged in regular long-range shooting with AR platforms, specifically within the 300-600 yard range, this mount is highly recommended.",1
"This work is highly engaging, rendering it difficult to pause its consumption. The anticipation for subsequent installments is significant. The author demonstrates a profound understanding of their craft, evidenced by a masterful command of language that is clearly discernible throughout the narrative.",1
"This multi-tool has been evaluated for its potential utility across various demanding professions. While not explicitly intended for everyday carry, its design suggests applicability for individuals engaged in roles such as SCCA corner working, emergency medical services, and firefighting. These professions often necessitate the manipulation of objects that may be hot, sharp, or require forceful application.

Initial assessment by a seasoned firefighter revealed several key observations. The tool's weight was noted as a potential consideration for sustained carry, yet it was also recognized that its integrated functionalities might permit the consolidation of several existing implements. Particular appreciation was expressed for the combination pliers and wire cutters, valued for their versatility in gripping, bending, and severing wires or grates. The integrated key slot for gas valve operation was immediately identified as a pertinent safety feature. Furthermore, the pry bar functionality was deemed potentially useful for overcoming obstacles such as jammed doors or for emergency window access. The sole point of contention, leading to a revised four-star rating, was the perceived limited efficacy of the fire hose tightening mechanism. It was observed that effective tightening of fire hose couplings typically requires the use of two such tools for adequate tension.

In summary, this tool presents a robust construction and incorporates several highly functional features. Its weight may be a minor drawback for some users. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration for individuals seeking a versatile, potentially life-saving implement for their emergency preparedness kits.",1
"This literary work presents a compelling collection of narratives, particularly resonant for aficionado of Ursula K. Le Guin's distinctive oeuvre. The volume commences with an authorial preface wherein Le Guin meticulously introduces each story. A significant portion of these tales are situated within the framework of her celebrated Ekumen, also known as her ""Hainish Universe."" Despite the inherent alien nature of these depicted cultures, their societal structures, and their customs, Le Guin consistently employs each narrative to illuminate the fundamental elements that unify humanity and define our shared human experience. These stories constitute the initial two-thirds of the book.

While Le Guin's Hainish narratives are undeniably captivating, the novelette titled ""Paradies Lost,"" which occupies the final third of the volume, offers a particularly profound and rewarding exploration. This piece represents a stylistic departure for the author, eschewing the established settings of the Ekumen for the confines of a generation spacecraft undertaking a 201-year voyage from Earth toward a designated ""New Earth"" in orbit around an unspecified neighboring star. The majority of the narrative focuses on characters who have spent their entire existence within this self-contained metallic and atmospheric environment. Their understanding of Earth is limited to representations through film and simulated reality programs; concepts such as ""sky"" are entirely beyond their comprehension. They have established their own intricate rituals and customs to structure their lives, until the inevitable necessity arises to disembark onto the surface of their new planetary destination. Ultimately, for certain colonists deeply entrenched in the familiarity of their enclosed universe, the very notions of ""OUTSIDE"" and ""NEW WORLD"" begin to evoke a sense of intimidation, even perceived malevolence. The narrative poignantly interrogates their capacity to adapt when the spacecraft reaches its intended harbor. Le Guin skillfully dissects this unique culture and its unfolding destiny, culminating in an ending that elicited a demonstrably emotional response. Across ""The Birthday of the World,"" the reader is consistently reminded of our shared human commonalities, irrespective of our geographical or cosmological location—be it on Gethen, within a spacecraft, on Earth, or elsewhere in the universe. We are presented with the universality of our loves, our hopes, and our fears, underscoring the profound truth that every day signifies the birthday of the world.",1
"Here are a few options for rewriting the product review in a polished, balanced, and slightly formal AI-style tone, while retaining the original meaning:

**Option 1 (Concise and Direct):**

> **Assessment:** The product's design, specifically its narrow width and steep incline, presents a significant usability challenge. Consequently, the intended canine users have demonstrated an unwillingness to engage with the ramp, rendering the purchase economically unviable.

**Option 2 (Slightly More Detailed):**

> **Product Performance Analysis:** Initial deployment of the ramp revealed a critical design deficiency. The narrow egress and pronounced gradient appear to have deterred the target animal subjects. This incompatibility has resulted in the product failing to fulfill its intended purpose, leading to a negative return on investment.

**Option 3 (Focus on Observation):**

> **Observed Outcome:** Upon introduction, the ramp's dimensions, characterized by its constrained width and steep trajectory, were found to be incompatible with the user group. The canine subjects exhibited a lack of adoption, indicating that the product's design specifications did not align with their requirements. This outcome represents a regrettable expenditure.

"**Analysis of Infant Engagement with the Caterpillar Toy**

This report details observations regarding a seven-month-old infant's interaction with a caterpillar-themed toy. The subject exhibits significant positive engagement, primarily driven by auditory and tactile stimulation.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Auditory Stimulation:** The infant demonstrates a clear preference for manipulating the toy in an oscillating motion. This action elicits an audible rattling sound, which appears to be a primary source of enjoyment and attention.
*   **Tactile Exploration and Oral Engagement:** The toy's varied textures are actively explored by the infant. Of particular note is the deliberate oral interaction with the antennae. The design feature of the antennae, measuring approximately one inch in length, mitigates concerns regarding potential choking hazards for an infant of this age.
*   **Overall Toy Preference:** Based on observed behaviors, the caterpillar toy has attained a status of high favor among the infant's current selection of play objects.",1
"This unit exhibits a functional discrepancy in its button placement relative to common user methodologies for fine-tuning molding, specifically in the context of coping saw applications.

The intended application involves precise marginal adjustments to molding materials, requiring accuracy to within 1/32 of an inch. The device's form factor precludes a pen-like grip, necessitating a more akin paring knife hold. Illumination provided by the integrated LEDs proves problematic, causing direct glare to the user's visual field. As the lighting lacks an off-switch, a physical obstruction using masking tape was implemented to mitigate this interference. Furthermore, the bit-locking mechanism is susceptible to unintended activation during the established grip protocol, leading to operational interruption. The speed adjustment controls, situated at the opposing extremity of the unit, present an inconvenience for real-time modification while engaged in use.

Despite these ergonomic and interface challenges, the device demonstrates considerable utility in its core function.",1

"Terrible product.

Does not support ""Wireless AP"" mode. Even if you manually disable DHCP, turn off SPI firewall, plugin  using LAN ports, it still restricts access to lan devices.

Also, it has LOTs of bugs including:
-Cannot allow WAN administration  from any BOGON networks. It looks like you can, but then errors out. Before applying settings
-By default it has vLAN tagging on port 3 and 4. but documentation does not tell you.
-Web admin interface is NOT httpS, and has no option to enable https.
-DNS is forcefully bound to the WAN port, thus to use it as a Wireless AP you must have a LAN cable attached... AND a LAN cable.
-Wireless defaults to use captive portal, even with guest Network turned off. So you have to enable guest Network, disable captive portal, click save, then disable guest Network again and NOW the non-guest network will work like it should. GAH! No way should anyone have to deal with this junk...

I have been trying to tell myself to just accept this devices issues, but even after hours of changing settings, it is impossible to make it work like it is supposed to. It is not even consistent, sometimes it will not let you connect, or will start dropping packets, so I have to use my old wireless as it, while older technogy, is reliable.

ONLY good thing about this device... the wireless range is very good. Unfortunately because some days it decides to just drop packets randomly, the range benefit is useless :(

*Note: TP-Link devices are ONLY good if you wipe original firmware and use OpenWRT. I have an older WDR4300 and a WDR810, with OpenWRT they work well... just old technology, unfortunately because Archer C9 uses Broadcom chip you cannot use OpenWRT.",1

"Enthralling doesn't even begin to cover this book. Ms. Kelly's story-telling and writing style in this book was more than I could have hoped for. The story was exciting, hot, and hilarious. The plot had me staying up into the night to read longer than I should have. The female characters are strong and take no-nonsense from the alpha males in their lives. The snarky, sassy personalities had me laughing and at times cringing at their crazy, yet courageous acts. Willow is incredibly strong and doesn't hold back. This makes for, at times, a hilariously volatile interaction with Mal. Mal is your alpha male with an overprotective personality. Oh yeah they are complete opposites! I'm not sure which characters I loved more though. The secondary characters were almost as involved as the main characters and had me falling in love with them and solidifying my new addiction to this series. I'm now impatiently waiting for Book 2 and my next love match. Nothing better than a promise of more of my new loves being the center of their own books. If you haven't read this book you need to! This author has yet to disappoint me but this is some of her best!",1
"I'm new to sourdough bread baking and new to the world of bread knives. My bread is super crusty on the bottom. Yes the knife is sharp. Yes it cuts very thin slices super straight and easily. However, when I get to the bottom of the slice I do have to saw a bit to get through it. The knife is flexible, and I'm not used to the feel of that, but it does a good job. It arrived quickly.",1
Love it. Got it for the Note 10.1 2014. Love the many angles to adjust the screen. All ports and buttons are available while in the case. High quality and secure.,1
This book is great. A guy turns his life around and becomes so much more. I can't wait to read more.,1
"I purchased the Capstar as a extra layer of security for my dog , it's probably one of the best medication to use for dogs  and cats it's non toxic for our animals and knock out fleas in 30 minutes . I also use the Seresto Fkea Collar on my Dal but in case it stops working before I can get another one on her I can give her a Capstar and know I've still got her protected from Fleas thanks to Capstar . According to my vet any flea medication is only 99% effective and knowing how well Capstar works for both cats and dogs I keep both of my animals protected ,I use Capstar for cats and small dogs as well for a backup . Thank you for the prompt shipping .",1
First I want to say thanks for gifting me this book. I really loved it. Ready for part two already,1
"This is a great bathroom radio.  It's moisture resistant, compact, and fairly attractive.  More importantly, the controls are very easy to operate, even with wet hands, and it sounds very good.  It has a weather band that is very useful.

I think it would be hard to do much better than this for a bathroom radio, and I recommend it most highly.",1
"Seemed to be a tad under 1-1/4"" - I wound up sending it back right away because the fit was a little sloppy on my buckle.",1
"The book was so, so good. I couldn't put it down because I definitely wanted to find out how this story was going to play out.  Talk about the sexy banter between Amber and Lance...so, good!  Lance mouth was just so deliciously sexy, off the chain.  Amber says ""You're not coming over"" Lance says ""I will be there and we both will be coming later""......Daym that was Hot!!  He can sneak in my bedroom at my parents house anytime!  The character development was really good, nice little twist in there.....I TOTALLY LOVED IT!  Lance became my favorite when I read ""Mate for Gideon""...He called Sarah, Prim (Ms. Prim & Proper), next to my boy Zane..I mean vamp..Love Zane!  Talk about eating humble pie...I  don't want to give anything away but when I read about the door slamming in the face, I thought that was the ultimate.  Ah mannnn, I died laughing, it was GREAT!  KARMA is something!  I loved the fact that Charlene brought back previous mates, I wish there was a bit more conversation, but it was cool.  Brant, Zane, lil Sam and Tanya...Tanya still holding off on sex to get her way??  She's something.  I totally hope Charlene give us story on the Elf Prince..who was the vamp he fell in love with, Brant's secretary?? I'm dying to find out!  Can't wait for Titan to get a mate. He's all messed up, want to read more about that species relations thing, hope there's a shifter females and vamp hook-up, witches were mentioned and did they say dragon shifters....Whoaaaa!  Looking forward to reading that....Keep these fun stories coming Charlene, they're great!",1
"Horrid! She's childish, hypocritical , repetitive, & completely dislikable. He's supposed to be alpha male billionaire , but begs, grovels, pleads, & bends over backward to become some Styrofoam vanilla ice cream cone for this chickNOTHING alpha about tgis dude! Boring! Repetitive ! Mundane! Longest an most boring sex scenes ive ever readim talking 20 plus pages of undressing, inner monologues, & grinding before another 10 pages of actual getting down to some boring intercourse.",1
"This is a fantastic book!  I enjoyed every page -- through humor, poignancy, insights.
I'd highly recommend this book to just about everybody.",1
My son likes this but because it folds in half the tent style doesn't stay upright for long. Keeps collapsing.,1
"It seems that getting older hasn't been a good thing for Mr. Higgins. His writing has become predictable and mundane. In this book Mr. Higgins often repeats character descriptions. It also always seems to rain in ""torrents"" . So much so that London would surely be suffering serious flooding. Also there is less differentiation among characters then there has been in Mr. Higgin's earlier works. I don't believe I will purchase another of his Sean Dillian books. They seem to be all the same story with less and less differentiation among plot lines.",1
"It is way to small, possibly perfect for maybe a small person? I am confused because an XL is suppose to mean Extra Large not Small...
One star for soft material and because zero wasn't optional.",1
"My daughter likes it, but it is literally the same story with a few embellishments as all the other Diana Prince/Princess Diana becomes Wonder Woman. Her mom doesn't want her to compete, she competes, she wins, she disguises herself, she saves mankind on the daily.

Sigh, good think 5 year-olds are fans of the familiar.",1
Spiritual. I would recommend this book for the spiritual journey it takes you through out the story. It is a feel good book.,1
I loved this book it made me smile and cry one of his best! Can't wait to read the next book.,1
For a cheap little car it was a lot of fun playing with it,1
"we like this little opener, real easy on my hands.",1
Well I agree with many reviews that the publisher often repackages previously published books into a new title to trick us but I don't remember having read any of these.  I have read all of ine In Death series orhottesthot I had.  Anyway I enjoyed these and have pre-ordered the next book.  Love having them all on my Kindle.,1
"What a ridiculous product.

I wanted to be able to download large numbers of photographs directly to this WD drive, but that is not possible. You must first download to your main drive, THEN TRANSFER ALL YOUR FILES MANUALLY to the WD drive for mirroring and cloud access. Needless to say, no one has time for that.

And the worst thing is, I didn't connect this device within the 30-day window for returns. So it's useless, and cannot be returned.

Ugh and fail all around.",1
"This product merits a strong recommendation, particularly for extended periods of use. Its exceptional comfort level has been consistently observed, rendering it a preferred choice for prolonged engagements.",1
battery  dead  in a very short time  used4 times for short time  they look nice when working,1
"my grandson is a big yugioh fan and this made him so happy! He is six and is teaching me how to battle the monsters against each other. Things that stretch his imagination and give him fantasy play are all right by me! It gives us something extra to fill our time together when he is visiting! Great stuff, excellent seller!",1
"This case has held up for about 8 months with two little male monsters. It has been dropped, thrown, drug, bounced, tossed, tickled, abused, hit, kicked, stood on, and fought over on a daily basis. Now that I write this review I'm starting to think that two-year-olds should not have an iPad. However, if you are nuts like me you can rest assured knowing that your iPad will survive anything your kids can throw at it.",1
The story was well written and I enjoyed reading about this time frame in Canada. Interesting to read about women's suffrage in Boston and Canada.,1
"It has hooks on one surface like in Velcro, that was a surprise. Pretty sure it performed better than the other brand that has green & yellow sponge on magnets.",1
"Mounted this on the stem of a Schwinn Excursion bike.  Easy to install with the provided O-Rings.  Wireless sensor mounted easily as well with its own O ring.  The spoke magnet was a little tricky to install but once I had it oriented the right way (directions are not crystal clear) it went off without a hitch.  The wheel sensor has a little green led that flashes when it detects the magnet so you can test the distance between magnet and sensor to make sure its correct and working.

The display comes setup for handle bar mounting but instructions are clear and simple if you need to change its orientation on the base plate for stem mounting.  The computer twists off the base plate so you can pocket it and walk away when leaving the bike locked up in a  dicey area.  The instruction book comes with a tire chart so you can set tire size without having to measure anything.

Keep in mind that the display never actually turns off; when it detects no activity for a while (15? minutes) it switches to standby mode and just shows computer model number.  Even with that the battery (CR2032) is said to last a year in both the computer and speed sensor so we will see.

The instruction booklet is a little dense as every page repeats the instruction in 5 or 6 languages but fairly simple to follow.",1
"What a great little movie.  I had never heard of this, but it popped up on my recommendations and got good reviews, so I gave it a try.  This so much reminded me of Donald Westlake's comic crime caper novels.  A great little story with plenty of laughs.  The plot involves a group of low rent, misfit criminals trying to pull of a heist of a lifetime, or as the call it, their 'Bellini'.  Well, complications occur, problems arise, and the whole thing gets rather messy.  William H. Macy is great along with Isaiah Washington, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, and Luis Guzman.  A great ensemble cast in a highly enjoyable, funny movie.  A sad note, I had heard Michael Jeter died recently, which is quite sad.  I thought he was great in the Green Mile.",1
"I don't watch much TV, but my husband was watching it one night and I sat down to be with him.  Well, I am HOOKED on this series.  I now own season 1, season 2 and have pre-ordered season 3.  The action is taut and thrilling and the interactions of the characters just grows on you, the acting is so real you almost think it's really happening.  I would recommend this to any ""horror"" story lover.",1
Works well definetly better than using vice clamps to remove hose clamps,1
"The light was brighter than others I have tried and I thought I would love it. I did love it for about a week and then it started to flash on and off very quickly.  Like there was a dance party going on in my yard:) it was not worth the Money to pay to send it back.  Very sad because, like I said it does throw a fair amount of light and even has choice of high or low mode.",1
"Excellent, you retain your mobility while carrying essential gear
in a light weight rig. The Multicam pattern is authentic, THX",1
It was a good book if you like that era. Some parts of it were a little far fetched but still a good read.,1
Story is pretty good so far will have to read the rest to see if it continues.  Not my favorite line of story but all in all grabs at you so that you want to see what Charlie will do.,1
This was a Christmas gift to my 8 year old and he loves it.  We set it up Christmas day and then left for a few days.  When we came back one of the cars wouldn't operate as it did before we left.  We did some switched batteries and tried some minor problem solving but the car just wouldn't work correctly.  Contacted the company and received a prompt response back.  Did the steps as was recommended to us from Tech Support and then gave them the results.  They again responded promptly and advised that they would need to send out a calibration tool but with the holidays and such we wouldn't have it until after the 1st of the year.  No problems here.  Rec'd the calibration tool earlier than I expected and performed the steps that were supplied and everything works great!  Couldn't be happier with the support we rec'd.  ...and love this racetrack.  Would definitely recommend.,1
I can't say enough good things about this ROku.  My wife loves it and the headset on the remote.,1
"This product elicits a highly favorable assessment. Its compact packaging, facilitated by an accompanying case, is a notable attribute. While the absence of reinforced grommets could be considered a minor point of improvement, it does not detract significantly from the overall utility. The ease with which the item can be repacked into its original pouch is a substantial advantage, rendering it an excellent component for an emergency preparedness kit.",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed these stories of childhood friends/lovers who were separated for reasons beyond their control and moved on with their lives. When they are reunited some 10 years or so later, sparks fly again and the chemistry between them is as strong as ever, but they must learn to let go of past hurts and rediscover each other again. The last story was a pleasant surprise because it was a contemporary romance instead of a regency romance like the first two, which was a nice change of pace.",1
"I love the Chuckit brand and the orange rubber balls are my dog's favorite so I thought for sure he'd love this one too. I'm not positive but I think it might be a tiny bit harder than the orange ones? Why am I rating a 4 when my dog doesn't like it? It's still a good, durable toy and I'm sure lots of other dogs would love it. My dog is obviously just a spoiled brat lol :)",1
The light shines bright and works like a charm to brighten up a dark room.,1
"This was on my hubby's xmas gift list.  He just loves it and uses it every day.  It is sturdy, attractive and easy to use.  My only problem with it is that we got the peppercorns long before the pepper mill arrived.",1
"They fit as expected, well ventilated for summer walks/runs, and I don't get blisters while wearing them. I have a hard step and I'm very active...have tried several different ""top-of-the-line"" well known brands, and have now settled on these as my go-to.",1
"It keeps our 3 month old GSD pup in a safe place, but he was able to bend the wires with his teeth.",1
This one was good. It had a lot going on but it was good still. I can't wait until the next book.,1
Great flip flop!  Ive had 4 pair and talked my wife into trying them this year and she loves them,1
This game is great.  Sometimes it takes longer than Monopoly though.,1
"September 30, 2017
Seller change your description of item this particular item is made for little-dogs not big ones. i just got mine today and my shorty-bull 44lbs broke it by one tug-pulled not even the lock held her strength. Therefore picture is much more deceiving and not what to expect when it arrives,  too small, narrow cording, cheaply made.",1
"Tin was awesome and looked Awesome, the cards were almost all trash for my deck. The price is worth it, but a warning that you might not get what you're after besides the cover card.",1
"I used to use a $1000 Lamello biscuit joiner when I worked in a cabinet shop. The dealt works amazingly well for how much it costs. I'm not saying it's as good as the Lamello, but its hard to tell the difference. This thing is accurate, easy to use, and I love the rack and pinion adjustment.",1
"The immersion blender itself is quite nice.  I like the adjustable speed - you can use a lower speed when blending in a smaller vessel.  But the accessories are terrible.  My plastic beaker leaks.  I know - hard to imagine a plastic beaker leaking, but sure enough this one drips out the bottom.  And the chopper attachment has no bearings there so it makes a shrieking sound when it runs.  I suppose it'll probably be quieter if you chop oily foods, but i was mixing dry ingredients.  I was actually trying to grind spices and found the blade too dull for that.  Probably not what it's meant for, so i can't blame the tool for that one.",1
You did it again Rhonda. I loved Chris and Kate in this sequel. And those Garrison females are something else. I hope we get to see if Chris wins an Oscar and if they ever get a chance to start that family they want. Keep them coming.,1
"I'm 5'9"" and 145lbs. The small fit me around the waist but they were too short. I wish these came in a longer pant size. The waist on the top was slightly boxy, and the fabric was slightly stiff - these issues would probably get better with washing. I like how there are so many pockets and the gathered waist in the back seems nice and secure so your pants won't fall down when you bend over.",1
"I Was looking for some free games to play.  I don't like it, it's more of a waste of time, than anything.",1
"I really loved this really great story.  I could not put the book down till I finished reading the whole wonderful story.
Thank you so very much for writing this wonderful story.",1

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands.",1
This was really a waste of money.  The old rabbit ears and converter worked better than this did.  Not happy.,1
My daughter has been watching the Supernatural series from the very start and was missing the seventh season. I bought it for her as a black Friday deal so it was super cheap and it arrived in record time. She loves it! I recommend it to anyone who loves Supernatural.,1
"This thing works great scares the crap out of poor cat but keeps her from trying to catch baseballs on my 70"" TV screen",1
Supposedly sticky. Not so - makes me slide all over the yoga studio floor.,1
"Ms. Hamilton continues to raise the bar in her latest, book 2 of the Highland Gardens time travel highland romance series, that is believable and history rich. It is filled with intrigue, finding love, and commitment to family. Finn is a high-powered modern rich man who longs for true love and a family like his cousin Laurie. He character is developed in such a matter that one has empathy and understanding that money and hotness doesnt always bring you happiness but more often loneliness and uncertainty as to who are your true friends and what true love is. Wow I love Elspeth, she is a strong woman but due to the era she was born and family duty puts love before family. Her character is truly thought provoking and though you want to scream don't take that from your fianc&eacute; we truly understand what the mens beliefs about women were back then compared to today. From my viewpoint there weren't any strong secondary characters but Caitrina and Douglas seemed to deserve a story. So for now I am waiting impatiently for book 3 of this series Just Wait For Me, A Highland Gardens Novel. To see the full review visit my blog: sportochicksmusings. blogspot.",1
"loved the scissors style tool, the tweezers and the bulb syringe.  The yellow tool (pictured on the left hand side) was pretty cool, BUT it broke the first day of use.  The quality of that tool was not as good as the other three.",1
"This was an excellent book. It introduces new and useful information (& conceptualizes older information) about a topic that is increasingly influencing human beings, and other animals. A bit scary, but inevitable.",1
Good Red/Green Dot scope. The dot itself can block out small targets at a distance but is generally good to 100 yards or so. Well worth the money.,1
"This really isn't even the same tool as the 2-ton cable puller.  I mean it is, but this thing is MASSIVE.  It weighs about 35 pounds and looks able to pull a house over.  The thing is so big it's almost difficult to work with.  You need to be rather strong to get it moved around set up even before you begin cranking.

This is very well made, of exceptional quality, and amazingly strong.  Made right here in the good old USA.  You can buy this thing, use the tar out of it, and give it to your grown child someday and he can then give it to his kid some day.  Really, it's that well made.  I just wish the manual did a little better job of indicating lubrication points.  Perhaps if it had a picture with arrows indicating spots to lubricate.",1
"While these are a little pricey, they are a great way to store all of those million little lego parts from Hero Factory sets.  The added bonus is these huge legos are actually toys themselves because they can be stacked just like the little legos.  Plus, they look great in a playroom!",1
Bought them for my daughter who loves Toms. They fit perfectly.,1
"Used the dress to do a 1920s inspired photoshoot. Dress fit the model as expected and seemed very durable for a 'costume' dress. The fringe and sequins held up well during the photoshoot. The fringe flowed really well while the model was dancing and moving making for some really great action shots. This would be an acceptable dress to wear out to any masquerade or 1920s themed event or as a halloween costume. The sequin trim in the neckline felt a little cheap, but from a distance or in photos it looks great!",1
its a compact bag. if you want carry more things. its better you bought bigger one. its tight fit bag. if you want to buy bag for only camera its a good one.,1
"This bacon cooking product is much more efficient than a previous, different style of bacon/microwave cooker. It is less messy with only one paper towel draped across the top. You can see how the bacon is cooking and either shorten the cooking time or lengthen it to have bacon just the way you like it or need it. Sometimes we need partially cooked bacon to use in recipes where it needs to be flexible for incorporation with other food, and then cooked to completion. This product perfectly satisfies that need. I highly recommend this product for anyone who uses/enjoys perfect bacon.",1
"This has been a nice little grill for making family breakfast. I like that it is none stick and has the cooling boundary around it. Bacon takes a while to cook on it but pancakes and eggs are fast. Decent to clean, wish it was dish washer safe. Over all very happy with it.",1
"My Boston Terrier has MegaEsophogus which causes regurgitation of food eaten hours earlier.  It's a must that I have a harness that falls below the throat while walking him as this exacerbates his condition.  With this ""Step-in"" harness, it sits low on his chest yet does a good job of holding him back.  Putting the harness on can be a bit of a challenge but I've figured that out rather quickly.  There is a bit of stretch after a month or 2 of use but not enough to make the harness useless.  And you can tighten it if you need to. All in all I am very pleased.",1
"Too small for anything useful.  I wanted to use one to cover the camera on my computers but they're too small! I'm sorry I bought them, but since they were so cheap,  I won't bother to return them.",1
"This is not a professional grade yoga mat, but it's perfect for beginners. It seems like it would eventually start shredding after a lot of use, but still a very nice yoga mat.",1
"We gave this to our 3 year old nephew for Christmas and he loved it.  He carried Caillou around with him during most of our visit.  As for durability, only time will tell.  But so far so good.  Caillou still has all his limbs!",1
"This video contains some interesting and mostly valuable material. The first section which introduces the viewer to extreme violence is not for children. There are a number of beheadings and the Columbine rampage. There is material I'd use in training, specifically Columbine. I asked a couple experienced officers to give me an opinion of the intro and even guys who've set a lot of autopsies found the beheadings disturbing. I think quite a few people might not get through the intro to the actual material. Howe knows what he's talking about and is well worth listening to and considering his points.",1
I assumed purchasing this light that for the price it would burn out immediately.  Not only has that not happened but I have owned it for over a year now and it is as good as new.  Buy with confidence.,1
"came soon after i ordered it , and worked great",1
Loved this story. It was hard to put the book down.,1
Does what it is suppose to do. Hot water in a flash,1
"This was an illuminating biography of a real boundary breaker.  Francis Perkins, whose politics leaned a bit further left than I personally stand, was nevertheless a thoroughly impressive female leader in a setting where outright hostility and malevolence based on gender alone was not only accepted but seemingly encouraged.  Ms. Perkins' sublime way of sidestepping blustering male counterparts and outwitting (and outworking) male adversaries whilst earning stolid loyalty and respect from open-minded men of the day remain admirable and shocking to a woman born in the late 20th century.  This is a great read!",1
"Just received today--another great one from Ina. My wife has many of these books. Each has go-to recipes, and this is no exception.",1
"Buy it for keeping in touch with my relatives inside large shopping centers when I am travelling, it works just fine!",1
"recieved free for honest review

60kg for medium sized dogs
retractable dog leash. Made of environmentally protection material TPE. ABS has a nice rubber grasp that is easy to hold and your hand does not slip off.
you press down on the black button to lock  and release to let it go. 4 meter cord.
the light takes three triple a batteries ( you have to provide those)
the light is very bright which I love. I live in the country so it is dark at night to take out the dog it is nice to have a built in light I do not have to search for. you can also take the light off if you want and hold it in your hand. I like to leave it as one piece so I don't lose it.
really well made hard durable plastic and the end of the leash has light reflector so you can be seen in the dark by cars.
I like this one very much and my pomerian who is three pounds can use it just fine.",1
"If they are shipped right they are supposed to be firm blocks that's easily crumbled into powdery flaky smell so good goodness for the cats (it appeals to my sense of smell and I HATE the smell of any wet can food)

I have no idea why people don't bother to just crumble it the way I do is just squeeze it firmly and add water and nutritional yeast (for the one cat with on/off diarrhea) and just give it a good stir. It takes less than a minute tops to be throughly mixed and water is absorbed. The cats do like it dry too but I rather have water in it to give them more moisture in their diet as they eat Orijen dry cat food. I also give them Stella and Chewys freeze dried food added into the mix some days as they eat that for treats.

My bengal is the picky eater the American Bobtail is the one with sensitive tummy and the sole reason why I brought a trail sized bag to test run it to give her supplements and she likes it as well as the Bengal so cant go wrong with this product but I strongly suggest you to purchase the trail size to test run it. Just crumble it its so easy to squeeze it and seeing it just flake away. I like the ease of grabbing a firm block instead of a messy thing.",1
"To date, I have read Nikki's Secret, Text Message and Scrapping the Bone and I have to tell you, William Malmborg delivers. His stories are not for meek, but they are not so far out there that people will be offended or put off by reading them. What I love about Malmborg's work is that it is a little racey, a little raunchy and a whole lot of fun. The story lines flow. Once you start reading, you cannot stop. It's like opening up a huge bag of Dorito's and saying ""I'll just have a few"". Can't do it. You dive into one of his books and you will be reading until 4 am just to see what the heck Nikki's Secret is, or how is Mallory going to walk into that men's bathroom and do that thing? You just have to find out. Each book is a decadent pleasure, a pure delight that you can sink your teeth into and get lost in the process. Read this guy; if you like raunchy, sexy, a little crazy and a fabulous story.",1
